We've got this playlist running on Youtube, been going a while now. It's open to any fan who wants to contribute. [get the collaborator code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLliE8mqiSLjwAANCaBK4wytB4FpTuc94E&jct=9fapxv7N6lBvGB9WTlQBgfKNjBA2yg) A collaborative playlist of classic vids. <strong>All fandoms welcome and loved.</strong> Does this vid touch your soul? Blow your mind? Wreck your head? Do you still think and talk about this vid years later? Did it start a genre of vidding? Is it on every rec list and frankly you are a bit bored of it now omg? Then add it today!

Obviously a lot of classic vids are not ON Youtube so this list could never be considered definitive even if it wanted to be, but there's still a shitload on there to add. Join in!
