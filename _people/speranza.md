bio: |
 I’ve been in fandom since *cough* and online fandom since *coughcough* but I am still young and extremely cute.  I’m the one who wanted us to own the goddamned servers so I guess that was me waving the flag on the barricades way back when.  I write a lot of fic and I vid when astolat makes me or when I just can’t help myself.  I like juggernaut fandoms.  It is a documented fact that I would do Anything For Love.
