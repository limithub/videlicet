bio: |
 I'm a longtime journalist with way too many obsessions and far too little spare time. So not so well rested. I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon's work. OK, "fan" doesn't quite cover it, but you get the idea.

 I've done plenty of fic writing, even more fic reading, and I got into vidding in Jan. 06. I started with Windows Movie Maker, moved to Ulead 10, currently using Corel. Love the creative process, love feedback. Restraining order love. Vidding led to a job as an online video editor, and for that I used Avid Xpress Pro.
